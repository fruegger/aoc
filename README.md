# Advent of Code
Every year, at the gates of December, a new adventurous and thrilling coding path towards Christmas appears through the slowly dissolving but yet incumbing layers of the all pervading
developer's everyday.

This is my diary of the effort I put in to travel this path and keep up with this nice albeit geeky and challenging tradition:

The curious, odd, mildly amusing or even remotely noteworthy is collected here.

## 2004 edition

For 2004, I wanted to take a short coding vacation and revisit a long forgotte place I had seen before. 
This time I'd travel to a different programming coutry I had more or less fond remembrances of.
As any self respecting tourist would, I surely would not miss any of the oddities, bizzare landmarks and memorable habits on my trip.

And so it was that I made my way through goLand.

Many a difficult piuzzle to solve would soon cross my way; armed with the utmost confidence that I'd always find the stupidest and most straightforward solution, 
I took that first stride on my quest to find the silliest way possible to use goLand features, constructs and particularities.

This are some entries in my log book:
